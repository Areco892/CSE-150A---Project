# CSE-150A---Project
Utility Based AI Agent

In this project, we will design a traffic control system using a utility-based agent that will help us optimize the flow of traffic. 
The environment would be modeled using an HMM, where previous data will help us predict future traffic movement, allowing us to optimize the flow of traffic. 
The agent will have the following parameters:
- Performance measure: minimization of traffic congestion, maximize traffic flow.
- Environment: urban road network.
- Actuators: traffic lights, pedestrian signals.
- Sensors: cameras, public transport data.
