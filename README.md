# CSE-150A---Project
Utility Based AI Agent
Alexander Huang

Abstract

In this project, we will explore how useful a utility based AI agent could be. This type of agent is especially useful when looking for the best option given certain parameters. So, our utility based AI agent will have the following descriptions.
Performance measure: its ability to find the best fit for given specifications. 
Environment will be datasets provided by the Internet (specifically found in kaggle.com)
Actuators: Text-based responses with the best fit 
Sensors: Probability algorithms, most likely using Bayes’ Rule, Marginalization, etc…

Data sets used: 
The Ultimate Cars Dataset 2024 - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdulmalik1518/the-ultimate-cars-dataset-2024
